# Physics Informed Neural Networks

This project will explore using Neural Networks to solve systems of partial differential equations, with a specific focus on those that represent physical systems.

Here are several resources that can help you understand and implement a physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving ballistics problems:

Hands-on Introduction to Physics-Informed Neural Networks: This tutorial on nanoHUB offers a comprehensive introduction to PINNs, focusing on how to incorporate differential equations into neural networks. It includes practical examples implemented in PyTorch, making it suitable for users familiar with conventional neural network training and PyTorch basics​ ("NanoHUB")​.

TensorFlow Tutorial for PINNs: This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to implementing PINNs using TensorFlow. It explains the core concepts of PINNs, including how to incorporate partial differential equations (PDEs) into the loss function, and provides code examples that you can adapt for your ballistics application​ (George Miloshevich)​.

GitHub Repository by Maziar Raissi: This repository contains extensive resources and examples on using PINNs for solving forward and inverse problems involving nonlinear PDEs. It includes detailed documentation and several example projects that demonstrate the application of PINNs to different types of physical problems, which can be highly relevant for your ballistics project​ (GitHub)​.
