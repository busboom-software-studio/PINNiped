# Physics Informed Neural Networks

This project will explore using Neural Networks to solve systems of partial differential equations, with a specific focus on those that represent physical systems.

Repo with a PINN that solves [Navier Stokes](https://github.com/hojunkim13/PINNs), and an [associated paper](https://maziarraissi.github.io/PINNs/)
